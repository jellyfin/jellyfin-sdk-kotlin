# Migrate to v1.2

Updating the SDK from version 1.1.z to 1.2.z is an easy task for Kotlin projects as there are no (runtime-) breaking
changes introduced. Java projects might need some additional work due to the Java compatibility changes.

## WebSockets

We've introduced a rewritten WebSocket API to make it easier to receive realtime events from the Jellyfin server.
Lean more on the [WebSockets](../websockets.md) page. The old WebSocket code is still available but will be removed
entirely in v1.3.

## Java compatibility

This version introduces new helpers for Java compatibility. Previous helpers have been renamed or removed.

- Removed JavaCallback
- Renamed JavaDataCallback to JavaResponseContinuation
- Added JavaFlow to receive flow data

Note that we still recommend writing code using the SDK in Kotlin.

### Exception for missing base url

Previously when calling an API without a URL set in the ApiClient an IllegalArgumentException was thrown. This has now
been changed to a newly introduced MissingBaseUrlException that extends our existing ApiClientException.
