# Migrate to v1.4

The update from version 1.3.z to 1.4.z is easy, there are no breaking changes in this update. The release focused on
performance improvements, bug fixes and the addition of request models.

## Request models

The biggest change in version 1.4 is the addition of request models. Previously calling the API with large requests
could be annoying because all parameters had to be added to the function call. Request models solve this problem
replacing the parameters with a data class to hold all values instead.

Here is an example for migrating a "getNextUp" API call from a parameter function to request model.

### Parameter function

```kotlin
val nextUp by api.tvShowsApi.getNextUp(
	userId = api.userId,
	imageTypeLimit = 1,
	limit = 10,
	fields = listOf(ItemFields.DATE_CREATED),
)
```

### Request model

```kotlin
val nextUpQuery = GetNextUpRequest(
	userId = api.userId,
	imageTypeLimit = 1,
	limit = 10,
	fields = listOf(ItemFields.DATE_CREATED),
)

val nextUp by api.tvShowsApi.getNextUp(nextUpQuery)
```

Request models are data classes, which means the `copy()` function can be used to change values. Request models are
available for all API calls that use five or more parameters. The parameter functions are still available. Both options
will be supported in future versions.
