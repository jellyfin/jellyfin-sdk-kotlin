# Migrate to v1.6

This release updates the generated API from Jellyfin server 10.9 to 10.10. The minimum supported server changed to
10.10.0.

## Deprecated ApiClient properties removed

It is no longer possible to set the baseUrl, accessToken, clientInfo or deviceInfo directly on ApiClient instances.
These setters were previously deprecated. Use the `update()` function instead.
