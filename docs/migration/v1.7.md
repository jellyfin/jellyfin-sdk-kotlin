# Migrate to v1.7

## Removed Java helpers

Utility functions to use the Kotlin SDK with the Java programming language have been removed. It's still possible to use
the SDK on the JVM.

## OkHttp by default

The SDK now uses OkHttp 4 as networking library by default. It is still possible to use Ktor with the
`jellyfin-api-ktor` package. The Ktor package will be removed in a future update.

### Threading

The SDK no longer manages its threads when invoking the (OkHttp based) ApiClient. It is therefor important to confirm
your usages do not run on the main thread. This may cause issues on specifically Android.

### OkHttp 5

The SDK is compatible with OkHttp 5 and will use it in the next release. If you want to use it right now you can add
OkHttp 5 as dependency to your client.

## ByteArrays

Places using the `ByteReadChannel` from Ktor have been changed to use `ByteArray` instead.

## User Agent

The ApiClient now sets a `User-Agent` header on network requests. The value is inferred from the supplied `ClientInfo`
and cannot be changed.
