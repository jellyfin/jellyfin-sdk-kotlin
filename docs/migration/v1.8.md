# Migrate to v1.8

## Removed Ktor package

The `jellyfin-api-ktor` package which exposes the `KtorClient` implementation for the API is now removed. It has been
replaced with the `OkHttpClient` introduced in version 1.7 of the SDK. The previous version of the package is still
compatible, although use is discouraged as it won't receive any more updates.
